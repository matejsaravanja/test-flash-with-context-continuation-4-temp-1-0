## About
This code was generated by [CodeCraftAI](https://codecraft.name)

**User requests:**
I want you to build me an app for buying premium NFTs. I want user to pay me 100 CRAFT (of course, user has to sign transaction). That transaction and user ownership of certain NFT should be stored somewhere. CRAFT is a Solana-based token btw. Once paid, user has to get access to that NFT in form of web, mail and image. For NFTs, generate some nice svg images.

Check OUTPUT.md for the complete unaltered output.

## Project Plan
```
Okay, I've reviewed the requirements and questions for clarification. Assuming some default answers for the clarification questions, here's a project plan for building your premium NFT purchase application.  I'll update this plan as the clarification questions are answered.

**Project: Premium NFT Purchase Application**

**Goal:**  Develop a web application where users can purchase premium NFTs with CRAFT tokens (Solana-based) and access the NFT in web, email, and image formats.

**Assumptions (Until Clarified):**

*   **SVG Generation:**  "Niceness" means a visually appealing and unique SVG design. A basic generative algorithm will be used to create varied SVG images.
*   **NFT Metadata:** Basic metadata (Name, Description) will be associated with each NFT.
*   **Email Content:** Email will contain the NFT name, a link to view the NFT on the web, and a link to download the SVG image.
*   **Database:** Using PostgreSQL because it's relational, robust, and well-suited for transactional data (like transaction history and user ownership tracking).

**I. Project Setup and Infrastructure (Sprint 0 - 1 week)**

**Tasks:**

1.  **Environment Setup:**
    *   Set up development and production environments (cloud provider - AWS/GCP/Azure/DigitalOcean).  Consider containerization (Docker).
    *   Repository Setup (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket).
    *   CI/CD Pipeline Setup (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).
2.  **Backend Framework Setup (Python - Django/Flask):**
    *   Initialize the Python backend project using a chosen framework.
    *   Define project structure and basic configurations.
    *   Establish database connection to PostgreSQL.
3.  **Frontend Framework Setup (React):**
    *   Initialize the React frontend project using Create React App (CRA) or similar.
    *   Setup basic routing and component structure.
4.  **Solana Development Environment Setup:**
    *   Install Solana CLI tools.
    *   Configure a Solana development wallet.

**Technical Considerations:**

*   **Cloud Infrastructure:** Select a cloud provider that offers suitable compute, storage, and database services.
*   **Containerization (Docker):** Use Docker for consistent development and deployment.
*   **CI/CD:** Implement a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
*   **Backend Framework Choice:** Django is more batteries-included, Flask is more lightweight and requires more explicit configuration. Consider project complexity when choosing the backend framework. Testing Framework.

**II. Backend Development (Sprint 1, 2 weeks)**

**Tasks:**

1.  **Database Design:**
    *   Design database schema for:
        *   Users (user ID, wallet address, email, etc.).
        *   NFTs (NFT ID, SVG data, metadata, creator, attributes).
        *   Transactions (transaction ID, user ID, NFT ID, timestamp, CRAFT amount).
2.  **Solana Integration:**
    *   Implement Solana blockchain interaction logic using a Solana SDK (e.g., `@solana/web3.js` in Javascript or similar library in Python).
    *   Implement function to verify CRAFT token balance.
    *   Implement transaction monitoring functionality to track and confirm token transfers.
3.  **API Endpoints:**
    *   Develop API endpoint to fetch NFT details (GET /api/nfts/{nft_id}).
    *   Develop API endpoint to initiate purchase (POST /api/purchase - returns a transaction to be signed).
    *   Develop API endpoint to verify transaction status (POST /api/verify_transaction).
    *   Develop API endpoint to retrieve NFT content (GET /api/nfts/{nft_id}/content).
4.  **Email Service Integration:**
    *   Integrate an email service (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun, AWS SES) for sending purchase confirmation emails.
    *   Implement email template for NFT access information (link to web view, image download link).
5.  **SVG Generation (Basic):**
    *   Implement a basic SVG generation algorithm in Python.  This will be refined based on further clarification of SVG requirements.

**Technical Considerations:**

*   **Solana SDK:**  Choose appropriate Solana SDK for Python.
*   **API Design Principles:**  Use RESTful API design principles.
*   **Security:**  Implement secure API endpoints and authentication.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling and logging.
*   **Asynchronous Tasks:**  Use asynchronous tasks (e.g., Celery) for background processing like transaction monitoring and email sending to avoid blocking API requests.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement API rate limiting to prevent abuse.

**III. Frontend Development (Sprint 2, 2 weeks)**

**Tasks:**

1.  **UI Design:**
    *   Design the user interface for the entire application, focusing on user-friendliness and a clean aesthetic.
2.  **Component Implementation:**
    *   Develop React components for:
        *   NFT browsing.
        *   NFT details page.
        *   Purchase flow (wallet connection, transaction signing).
        *   NFT web view.
3.  **Solana Wallet Integration:**
    *   Integrate a Solana wallet adapter (e.g., Phantom, Solflare) to allow users to connect their wallets.
4.  **API Integration:**
    *   Integrate the React frontend with the backend API endpoints.
5.  **State Management:**
    *   Choose and implement a state management solution (e.g., Context API, Redux, Zustand) for managing application state.

**Technical Considerations:**

*   **React Hooks:**  Utilize React Hooks for managing component state and side effects.
*   **UI Library:** Consider using a UI library (e.g., Material UI, Ant Design, Chakra UI) for pre-built components.
*   **Wallet Adapters:**  Choose a wallet adapter that supports multiple Solana wallets.
*   **Responsiveness:**  Ensure the application is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

**IV. Testing and Refinement (Sprint 3, 1 week)**

**Tasks:**

1.  **Unit Testing:**
    *   Write unit tests for individual backend functions and frontend components.
2.  **Integration Testing:**
    *   Perform integration tests to ensure that the backend and frontend components work together correctly.
3.  **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**
    *   Conduct UAT with a small group of users to gather feedback and identify any remaining issues.
4.  **Bug Fixing:**
    *   Fix any bugs identified during testing.
5.  **Performance Optimization:**
    *   Optimize the application for performance and scalability.

**Technical Considerations:**

*   **Testing Frameworks:**  Use appropriate testing frameworks for Python (e.g., pytest) and React (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library).
*   **Code Coverage:**  Aim for high code coverage with unit tests.
*   **Performance Monitoring:**  Use performance monitoring tools to identify bottlenecks.

**V. Deployment and Monitoring (Sprint 4, 1 week)**

**Tasks:**

1.  **Deployment to Production:**
    *   Deploy the backend and frontend applications to the production environment.
2.  **Monitoring Tools Setup:**
    *   Set up monitoring tools to track application performance and identify any issues.
3.  **Logging:** Configure robust logging to track errors and user data.
4.  **Documentation:**
    *   Create documentation for the application, including API documentation and user guides.

**Technical Considerations:**

*   **Deployment Strategy:** Choose an appropriate deployment strategy (e.g., blue-green deployment, rolling deployment).
*   **Monitoring Tools:**  Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or similar to monitor the application.
*   **Scaling:**  Plan for scaling the application to handle increasing traffic.

**Post-Launch Activities:**

*   **Ongoing Monitoring and Maintenance.**
*   **Gather User Feedback and Implement Improvements.**
*   **Consider Adding Features Based on User Requests.**

This is a basic project plan. We will need to adjust based on the answers to my clarification questions.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Answer the Clarification Questions.**
2.  **Refine the Project Plan.**
3.  **Prioritize Tasks within Each Sprint.**
4.  **Assign Resources to Tasks.**

Let me know when you have the answers to the clarifications. I'm ready to help you refine this plan and get started on your project.
